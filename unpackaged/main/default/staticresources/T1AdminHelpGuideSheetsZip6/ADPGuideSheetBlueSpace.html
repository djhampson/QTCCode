						BlueSpace is the term given to a market space in which YOU have no business so far.  The BlueSpace tool considers YOUR current penetration by product and geography, identifying the available headroom in to which YOU have the opportunity to grow.  YOUR ACCOUNT penetration is classified as none (blue space), least, some and most, giving YOU a view of your share versus your two fiercest competitors.  
						<ul>
							<li>The resulting Heat Map identifies patterns of current coverage, highlighting areas of future opportunity.</li>
							<li>The Headroom tool allows YOU to view the ACCOUNT’s current spend (Estimated Realisable Value (ERV)), the competition’s share, YOUR share and YOUR forecast share for the next two years.  A second view, Share of Wallet, allows a quick review of share by geography and product line.</li>
