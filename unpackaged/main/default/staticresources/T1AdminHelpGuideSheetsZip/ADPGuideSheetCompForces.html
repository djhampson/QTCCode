						To provide an understanding of the competitive environment of the ACCOUNT’s market and the dynamics that exits within it. To determine the likely affects and the consequent business drivers the ACCOUNT faces and determine the likely business response by the ACCOUNT to those business drivers to help YOU determine the Long Term Sustainable Mutual Business Value that you can achieve working with the ACCOUNT.

						CompetingForces determines the market pressures and the environment that the ACCOUNT will be operating in. High rivalry limits profitability; depending first, on the intensity with which companies compete and, second, on the basis on which they compete. Based on Michael Porter’s classic work on industry profitability, CompetingForces considers the relative strengths of the different types of competition; existing competitors; buyers and suppliers, new entrants and substitutes, the outcome of which is an analysis of the intensity and type of competition YOUR ACCOUNT faces which then guides you to determining the business drivers and likely business responses that the client will be making.

	            			<li>Determine the rivalry amongst existing competition and for each one evaluate their relative size to the ACCOUNT and the degree of alignment they have with the Critical Needs of the ACCOUNT's market.</li>
	            			<li>Move the ‘post it’ note for each competitor along the two axis of relative size and the degree of alignment to their market's needs to give a relative score in terms of rivalry. This will be attributed to individual competitors and existing competition in general.</li>
	            			<li>Establish the relative bargaining power of major suppliers, moving the ‘post it’ note along the two axis of the alignment of the supplier’s products and services relative to the ACCOUNT’s and the number of suppliers the account has.</li>
	            			<li>Determine the threat of new entrants, moving the ‘post it’ note along the two axis of the size of the threatening company relative to the ACCOUNT and the degree of alignment with the critical needs of the market.</li>
	            			<li>Determine the threat of substitutes, moving the ‘post it’ note along the two axis of the size of the threatening company relative to the ACCOUNT and the degree of alignment with the critical needs of the market.</li>
	            			<li>Establish the relative bargaining power of major buyers (customers), moving the ‘post it’ note along the two axis the alignment of the buyer’s products and services relative to the ACCOUNT’s and the number of buyers the account has.</li>
	            			<li>Firstly review the competing forces and document the effect in terms of the business drivers on the ACCOUNT:
								<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
									<li>Consider all competitors within the view of the overriding competitive landscape. The relative size of the boxes illustrates the relative strength by competitor type.</li>
									<li>While all threats will have a consequent effect on margin, each is subtly different.
										<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
											<li>Intense rivalry amongst existing competitors drives down margin and forces organizations to seek product and service differentiation.</li>
											<li>Should suppliers have strong bargaining power, then the ACCOUNT will be looking to standardise on components to make switching suppliers easier.</li>
											<li>To scare off new entrants the ACCOUNT will seek to raise the barriers of entry by, for example accelerating product development.</li>
											<li>To stave off the threat of substitutes the ACCOUNT will seek to broaden their product offering.</li>
											<li>To negate buyers’ purchasing power the ACCOUNT will seek to expand their services and the value they deliver so that it is harder for them to switch supplier.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
	            			<li>Secondly review the competing forces by competitor and document the effect (driver) that the major competitors have on the ACCOUNT.</li>
	            			<li>Thirdly review the competing forces by threat type and again document the effect (driver) the threat type has on the ACCOUNT.
								<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
									<li>If the major threat is competitors competing on cost, then the ACCOUNT is likely either to be differentiating their products or services, or looking for operational efficiencies.</li>
									<li>If the major threat is market leadership, then the ACCOUNT is likely to be responding by further enhancing its product offering and scale, or looking to differentiate on cost or customer intimacy.</li>
									<li>If the major threat is competitors competing on customer intimacy, then the ACCOUNT will either be looking to differentiate themselves in terms of cost, scale or product range or seeking to compete head on and improve their ability to bespoke products and services.</li>
