					The ValuMill draws on work done in areas of the 4x4 questions in order to create a compelling statement about how YOU will be able to bring more value than the competition in order to win the bid.
					<br/>
					Using evidence already established in a variety of questions in the 4x4, the ValuMill directs YOU to craft statements in relation to the benefits, advantages and features (always get YOUR benefit statements up front and talk about YOURself last!), pass them through two filters that judge their business strength and level of uniqueness.

						<ul>
							<li>When presenting the value proposition, consider the mix of points YOU present in terms of points of parity, points of difference and points of resonating value.  It may be that YOU need to highlight a point of parity in that it may be fundamental to a PROSPECT’s needs.</li>
							<li>To create clear water between YOU and the competition YOU need to differentiate YOUR offer.  Points of difference need to be related to client needs, but those that are not might still be of future benefit and YOUR bid might benefit from their inclusion, albeit they will need explaining.</li>
							<li>Ultimately YOU will aim to build enough knowledge through experience of the value YOU have delivered and research in YOUR market of the business drivers and benefits in general that YOU will tailor YOUR offer around ‘points of resonating focus’.  Points of resonating focus are benefits that are hopefully unique to YOUR solution and which address fundamental business drivers that will be of most benefit to the PROSPECT’s business in the foreseeable future.</li>
