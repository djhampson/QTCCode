    <description>While the behavioural discounting model may allow for a certain % depending on the construct of an opportunity, there will be times where we may hold back offering the discount or go in with a lower discount (i.e 15% instead of the allowed 20%).  Exec want to capture where we are closing opportunities at book price or where pre-approved discounts were allowed but not used or reduced.</description>
