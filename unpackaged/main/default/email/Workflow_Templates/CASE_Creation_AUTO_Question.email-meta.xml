    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

A new question case has been raised with TechnologyOne Support Centre. As an alternative, the Customer Community is a hub for users like yourself using TechnologyOne software and they may have the answer that you are looking for. 
 Please consider asking the community using the ‘Ask a Question’ button for future questions or even this one. 

Please find the following details for your question case:

Case Number:  {!Case.CaseNumber}
Product:  {!Case.Customer_Product__c}
Functional Area:  {!Case.Functional_Area__c}
Case Subject:  {!Case.Subject}
Case Type:  {!Case.Type}
Customer Reference:  {!Case.Customer_Reference__c}

Your new question case will be assigned to a specialised Support Consultant for review in due course. Please note that I am experiencing an issue cases (Incidents) will take priority over questions for a response. We recommend you use the Customer Community to self-help or ask your question through that collaboration channel. 


Kind regards,

{!Case.EmailSig__c}
