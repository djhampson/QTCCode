    <textOnly>Hi {!P_S_Survey_Recipient__c.Contact_First_Name__c}, you were kind enough to provide some feedback on Tech One when I introduced the success program to you some time back.

I’m keen to see whether you are seeing value from the program and whether we’ve made improvements in any areas yet.

Could I ask you to review the questions in our survey and provide a score as things stand today?

COMPLETE THE SURVEY



Thanks for your support and feedback.

Regards,
Stephen Williams
Director - Customer Success
